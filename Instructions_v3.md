# the app should behaves like accent coach and should be able to make real fluid conversation with the user

# the main focus should be on the conversation but also help the user to improve his grammar.

# the app should be able to 
- correct the users grammar
- correct the users pronunciation
- decide by itself if the user should repeat the sentence when the pronunciation is not good enough
- give the user a score between 0 and 100 
- the score should be based on the grammar and pronunciation

# the app should have geolocation enabled and should have a leaderboard score based on the ip address of the user

# please clean all the code and remove all the old code to aovoid any conflicts

# make commits after every step
